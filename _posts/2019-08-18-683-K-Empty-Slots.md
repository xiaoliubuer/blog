You have N bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to N. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. We turn on exactly one bulb everyday until all bulbs are on after N days.

You are given an array bulbs of length N where bulbs[i] = x means that on the (i+1)th day, we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and x is 1-indexed.

Given an integer K, find out the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs that have exactly K bulbs between them that are all turned off.

If there isn't such day, return -1.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
bulbs: [1,3,2]
K: 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first day: bulbs[0] = 1, first bulb is turned on: [1,0,0]
On the second day: bulbs[1] = 3, third bulb is turned on: [1,0,1]
On the third day: bulbs[2] = 2, second bulb is turned on: [1,1,1]
We return 2 because on the second day, there were two on bulbs with one off bulb between them.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
bulbs: [1,2,3]
K: 1
Output: -1
```
Note:
```
1 <= N <= 20000
1 <= bulbs[i] <= N
bulbs is a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.
0 <= K <= 20000
```
```c++

        vector<int> days(flowers.size());

            days[flowers[i] - 1] = i + 1;
    
        int left = 0, right = k + 1, res = INT_MAX;
        for( int i = 0; right < days.size(); i++ ){
            if( days[i] < days[left] || days[i] <= days[right] ){
