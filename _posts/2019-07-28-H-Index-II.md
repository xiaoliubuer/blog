Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:
```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
```
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int left=0, len = citations.size(), right= len-1,  mid;
        while(left<=right)
        {
            //mid=(left+right)>>1;
            mid = ( left + right )/2;
            if( citations[mid] == ( len-mid )) return citations[mid];
            else if(citations[mid] > (len-mid)) right = mid - 1;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return len - (right+1);
    }
};
```
