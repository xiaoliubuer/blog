Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

Example 1:
```
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
```
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
The given board size is always 9x9.

# Funciton signature
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        
    }
};
```
# 题意
就是给一个数独的矩阵，里面被部分填了一些数，判断这个数独矩阵是不是合法的。就是每行，每列，以及每个3 * 3的小矩阵里，都只有1到9每个数字。 注意：这个不是判断这个矩阵是否可解。只是棋盘是否合法即可。

# Thinking
The worest way is to check row by row, col by col and cube by cube. It works, but it's too unefficient.

Another way??

# Shame answer
```c++
class Solution
{
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char> > &board)
    {
        int used1[9][9] = {0}, used2[9][9] = {0}, used3[9][9] = {0};
        
        for(int i = 0; i < board.size(); ++ i)
            for(int j = 0; j < board[i].size(); ++ j)
                if(board[i][j] != '.')
                {
                    int num = board[i][j] - '0' - 1, k = i / 3 * 3 + j / 3; //没懂这是想干啥
                    if(used1[i][num] || used2[j][num] || used3[k][num])
                        return false;
                    used1[i][num] = used2[j][num] = used3[k][num] = 1;
                }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
