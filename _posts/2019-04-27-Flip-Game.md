You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

Example:
```
Input: s = "++++"
Output: 
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
Note: If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].
```
```c++
// Boring!!!
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) {
        vector<string> res;
        for ( int i = 0; i + 1 < s.size(); i++){
            if ( s[i] == '+' && s[i+1] == '+'){
                s[i] = s[i+1] = '-';
                res.push_back(s);
                s[i] = s[i+1] = '+';
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
