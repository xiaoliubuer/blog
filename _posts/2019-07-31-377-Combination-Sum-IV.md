Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
```
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
 

Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

```c++
class Solution {
public:
   int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<unsigned int> result(target + 1);
        result[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
            for (int x : nums) {
                if (i >= x) result[i] += result[i - x];
            }
        }
        
        return result[target];
    }
};
