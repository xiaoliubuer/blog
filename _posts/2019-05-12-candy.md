There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, 1);
        int sum = 0;
        for ( int i = 1; i < n; i++ ) {
            if (ratings[i-1] < ratings[i]) dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1;
        }
        
        for ( int i = n-1; i > 0 ; i-- ){ // important!!!
            if(ratings[i-1] > ratings[i])
                dp[i-1] = max(dp[i] + 1, dp[i-1]);
        }
        
        for ( auto i : dp) sum += i;
        return sum;
    }
};
```
