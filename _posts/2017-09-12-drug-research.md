#### __Drug name type__

Generic drugs are required to have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as the brand name product. Generic drugs do not need to contain the same inactive ingredients as the brand name product.

#### __In-network vs. Out-network__

“In-network” health care providers have contracted with your insurance company to accept certain negotiated (i.e., discounted) rates. You're correct that you will typically pay less with an in-network provider. “Out-of-network” providers have not agreed to the discounted rates.


#### __Drug Status__


#### __Original Medicare__
Original Medicare is just that: the components of the Medicare program signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 30, 1965.
Sometimes called “traditional Medicare,” Original Medicare is the fee-for-service program in which the government pays directly for the health care costs you incur. The coverage allows you to see a doctor anywhere in the country (as long as the doctor accepts Medicare).

When it became law, Medicare consisted of two parts – and they’re the same two parts providing coverage to millions of Americans 45 years late. It includes Part A and Part B.


#### __Medicare Part A – hospital insurance__

Medicare Part A is called “hospital insurance” because it provides broad coverage of inpatient expenses, including not only hospital visits, but inpatient care in skilled nursing facilities, hospice care and home health services. The coverage is typically free if you’re 65 and you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes during the years you worked.


#### __Medicare Part B – medical insurance__

While Part A basically covers inpatient services, Medicare Part B is also referred to as “medical insurance” because it covers medically necessary services – including physician and nursing fees, x-rays, diagnostic tests, blood transfusions, chemotherapy, renal dialysis, and some vaccinations – and also preventive services. Enrollees pay a monthly Part B premium, but your other costs depend on whether you’re enrolled in Medicare Part A, or in another Medicare health plan.


#### __fee-for-service__

DEFINITION: Fee-for-service is a system of health care payment in which a provider is paid separately for each particular service rendered. Original Medicare is an example of fee-for-service coverage.



#### __inpatient care__
DEFINITION: Inpatient care is medical treatment administered to a patient whose condition requires treatment in a hospital or other health care facility.


##### __PDP__
DEFINITION: A prescription drug plan (PDP) is one option for individuals who want to enroll in the Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, which subsidizes the costs of prescription drugs for enrollees. A prescription drug plan (PDP) is a stand-alone plan, covering only prescription drugs.


#### __What's The Difference Between HMO and PPO Plans?__

It’s good to have choices. When it comes to health insurance, you have your choice of several plan types. Two you’ve probably heard of are a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO). Generally speaking, the difference between HMO and PPO plans includes the size of the plan network, ability to see specialists, plan costs, and coverage for out-of-network services.

Let’s take a closer look at each plan type to see how they're alike, how they differ, and how you can choose the type of plan that meets your needs.

#### __HMO ( Health Maintenance Organization )__
[More info](https://www.medmutual.com/For-Individuals-and-Families/Health-Insurance-Education/Health-Insurance-Basics/Types-Health-Insurance/HMO-Health-Insurance-Plans.aspx)

An HMO gives you access to certain doctors and hospitals within its network. A network is made up of providers that have agreed to lower their rates for plan members and also meet quality standards. But unlike PPO plans, care under an HMO plan is covered only if you see a provider within that HMO’s network. There are few opportunities to see a non-network provider. There are also typically more restrictions for coverage than other plans, such as allowing only a certain number of visits, tests or treatments. 

Some other key points about HMOs:

Some plans may require you to select a primary care physician (PCP), who will determine what treatment you need.
With some plans, you may need a PCP referral to be covered when you see a specialist or have a special test done.
If you opt to see a doctor outside of an HMO network, there is no coverage, meaning you will have to pay the entire cost of medical services.
Premiums are generally lower for HMO plans, and there is usually no deductible or a low one.
Some HMO plans, including those offered by Medical Mutual, don't require you to select a PCP or have a referral to see a specialist.

#### __PPO ( Preferred Provider Organization )__
[More Info](https://www.medmutual.com/For-Individuals-and-Families/Health-Insurance-Education/Health-Insurance-Basics/Types-Health-Insurance/PPO-Health-Insurance-Plans.aspx)

PPO plans provide more flexibility when picking a doctor or hospital. They also feature a network of providers, but there are fewer restrictions on seeing non-network providers. In addition, your PPO insurance will pay if you see a non-network provider, although it may be at a lower rate. 

Here are some key features:

You can see the doctor or specialist you’d like without having to see a PCP first.
You can see a doctor or go to a hospital outside the network and you may be covered. However, your benefits will be better if you stay in the PPO network.
Premiums tend to be higher, and it’s common for there to be a deductible.


#### __SNPs (Special Needs Plans)__

Medicare SNPs are a type of Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO). Medicare SNPs limit membership to people with specific diseases or characteristics. Medicare SNPs tailor their benefits, provider choices, and drug formularies to best meet the specific needs of the groups they serve.

#### __Primary Care or Specialist?__

Do you need a primary care physician that you’ll want to see for routine issues and examinations? Or, do you need a specialist that focuses on one specific area or issue? If you’re looking for a specialist, make sure he or she is board-certified in the field. Board certification means that the specialist has taken a training program and passed required examinations in that field. Primary care physicians may be certified as well, but their certification is likely to be more general, such as Family Medicine or Internal Medicine.


#### __medicaid vs medicare__

Both can help you pay for healthcare, but Medicare is an entitlement for seniors 65 and over – and some younger people with disabilities – while Medicaid is a public-assistance program for needy Americans of all ages. Here's how to tell them apart and discover whether you qualify for either or both of them.

Medicare is a federal program that provides health coverage if you are 65 or older or have a severe disability, no matter your income. Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides health coverage if you have a very low income.



#### __Deductible__
The amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.

After you pay your deductible, you usually pay only a copayment or coinsurance for covered services. Your insurance company pays the rest.

Many plans pay for certain services, like a checkup or disease management programs, before you've met your deductible. Check your plan details.
All Marketplace health plans pay the full cost of certain preventive benefits even before you meet your deductible.
Some plans have separate deductibles for certain services, like prescription drugs.
Family plans often have both an individual deductible, which applies to each person, and a family deductible, which applies to all family members.
Generally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher deductibles. Plans with higher monthly premiums usually have lower deductibles.


#### __Copayment__
A fixed amount ($20, for example) you pay for a covered health care service after you've paid your deductible.

Let's say your health insurance plan's allowable cost for a doctor's office visit is $100. Your copayment for a doctor visit is $20.

 * If you've paid your deductible: You pay $20, usually at the time of the visit.
 * If you haven't met your deductible: You pay $100, the full allowable amount for the visit.


#### __Coinsurance__
The percentage of costs of a covered health care service you pay (20%, for example) after you've paid your deductible.

Let's say your health insurance plan's allowed amount for an office visit is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%.

If you've paid your deductible: You pay 20% of $100, or $20. The insurance company pays the rest.
If you haven't met your deductible: You pay the full allowed amount, $100.
Example of coinsurance with high medical costs

Let's say the following amounts apply to your plan and you need a lot of treatment for a serious condition. Allowable costs are $12,000.

Deductible: $3,000
Coinsurance: 20%
Out-of-pocket maximum: $6,850
You'd pay all of the first $3,000 (your deductible).

You'll pay 20% of the remaining $9,000, or $1,800 (your coinsurance).

So your total out-of-pocket costs would be $4,800 — your $3,000 deductible plus your $1,800 coinsurance.

If your total out-of-pocket costs reach $6,850, you'd pay only that amount, including your deductible and coinsurance. The insurance company would pay for all covered services for the rest of your plan year.

Generally speaking, plans with low monthly premiums have higher coinsurance, and plans with higher monthly premiums have lower coinsurance.
