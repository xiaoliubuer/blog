Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
Note:
```
You may assume both s and t have the same length.
```
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        char map_s[128] = { 0 };
        char map_t[128] = { 0 };
        int len = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        {
            if (map_s[s[i]]!=map_t[t[i]]) return false;
            map_s[s[i]] = i+1;
            map_t[t[i]] = i+1;
        }
        return true;   
    }
};
```
