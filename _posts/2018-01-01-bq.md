At Uber, we believe in collaboration and sharing ideas. Most importantly, you'll need more information from the interviewer to analyze & answer the question to its full extent.

It's OK to question your interviewer.
When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it.
If you don't understand - ask for help or clarification.
If you need to assume something - verbally check its a correct assumption,
Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.
Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she will be as interested in your process of thought as your solution.
Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're doing.
Finally, listen - don't miss a hint if your interviewer is trying to assist you!
Interviewers will be looking at the approach to questions as much as the answer:
Does the candidate listen carefully and comprehend the question?
Are the correct questions asked before proceeding? (important!)
Is brute force used to solve a problem? (not good!)
Are things assumed without first checking? (not good!)
Are hints heard and heeded?
Is the candidate slow to comprehend / solve problems? (not good!)
Does the candidate enjoy finding multiple solutions before choosing the best one?
Are new ideas and methods of tackling a problem sought?
Is the candidate inventive and flexible in their solutions and open to new ideas?
Can questioning move up to more complex problem solving?
Still reading...?
