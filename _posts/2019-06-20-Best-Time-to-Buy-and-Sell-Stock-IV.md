Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```
```c++
class Solution {
public:
 int maxProfit(int k, vector<int> &prices) {
        int len = prices.size();
        if (len<2) return 0;
        if (k>len/2){ // simple case
            int ans = 0;
            for (int i=1; i<len; ++i){
                ans += max(prices[i] - prices[i-1],0);
            }
            return ans;
        }
        int hold[k+1];
        int rele[k+1];
        for (int i=0;i<=k;++i){
            hold[i] = INT_MIN;
            rele[i] = 0;
        }
        int cur;
        for (int i=0; i<len; ++i){
            cur = prices[i];
            for(int j=k; j>0; --j){
                rele[j] = max(rele[j],hold[j] + cur);
                hold[j] = max(hold[j],rele[j-1] - cur);
            }
        }
        return rele[k];
    }
};
```
