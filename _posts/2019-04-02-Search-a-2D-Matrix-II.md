Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
Example:

Consider the following matrix:
```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]

Given target = 5, return true.

Given target = 20, return false.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int row = matrix.size();
        int col = matrix[0].size();
        int i = row-1,j =0;
        while(i>=0&&j<=col-1)
        {
            if(target>matrix[i][j])
            {
                j++;
            }
            else if(target<matrix[i][j])
            {
                i--;
            }
            else
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
