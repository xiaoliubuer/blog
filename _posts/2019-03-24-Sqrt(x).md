Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```
```c++
// 这个二分法的思路非常有意思!!!
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int low = 0,  high = x, mid;
        if(x<2) return x; // to avoid mid = 0
        while(low<high)
        {
            mid = (low + high)/2;
            if(x/mid >= mid) low = mid+1;
            else high = mid;
        }
        return high-1;
        
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        return (int)sqrt(x);
    }
};
```
